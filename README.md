# Project

This Project gives an idea of how to predict the taxes that the residents from NewLand should pay given their personal information. Multiple machine learning algorithms were used to achieve this goal, but our best model revealed to be Gradient Boosting with 88% accuracy on train and 87.4% on validation. The time that took each model to run as well the computational expenses were also taken in consideration.
